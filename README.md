## General Instructions:
- Make sure to have Python installed on your system.

## 1. Temperature Converter

## Description
This Python program allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It supports bidirectional conversions between all three scales.

## Features
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
- Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
- Convert Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## How To Use
- Clone the repository.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to select the  conversion type and input the temperature value.
## Technology Used
- Python: This project uses Python as the programming language to implement the temperature conversion logic.
- Basic I/O: The program uses standard input/output to interact with the user, allowing them to input the temperature and select the conversion type.
  
## 2. Random Number Guessing Game
## Description
This game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program provides feedback to help users refine their guesses.

## Features
- Generates a random number.
- Prompts the user for guesses and provides feedback on whether their guess was too high or too low.
- Keeps track of the number of attempts.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Run the file.
- Guess the randomly generated number until you win!

## Technology Used
- Python: The game logic is written in Python, utilizing control flow statements such as loops and conditionals to handle user guesses.
- Random Module: The random module is used to generate a random number that the user needs to guess.
- Basic I/O: The game uses standard input/output for user interaction, prompting users for their guesses and providing feedback.


## 3. Sudoku Puzzle 
## Description
This program automatically solves a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It accepts a 9x9 grid with blank spaces represented by 0 and fills in the blanks while following the rules of Sudoku.
## Features
- Input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle.
- Solve it using a backtracking algorithm.
- Display the solved Sudoku puzzle.
## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- The program solves the hardcoded Sudoku puzzle grid, or you can modify the grid within the script to test different puzzles.
## Technology Used:
- Python: The Sudoku solving logic is implemented in Python using functions and algorithms.
- Backtracking Algorithm: A recursive backtracking algorithm is employed to find the solution to the Sudoku puzzle by checking the validity of numbers.
- Basic I/O: The program outputs the solved Sudoku grid or indicates if no solution exists.

## 4. E-commerce Product Data Scraper
## Description
This Python web scraping program extracts product information, such as names, prices, and ratings, from an e-commerce website. The data is then stored in a structured CSV format.

## Features
- Extracts product names, prices, and ratings.
- Saves the extracted data into a CSV file for further analysis.
## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Replace the URL in the code with the target e-commerce website URL.
- View the extracted product data in the product_info.csv file.
## Technology Used:
- Python: Python serves as the core language for web scraping and data handling.
- Requests: The requests library is used to fetch the HTML content from the target e-commerce website.
- BeautifulSoup: The BeautifulSoup library from bs4 is used to parse the HTML content and extract the required product information (names, prices, ratings).
- CSV File Format: The extracted data is saved in a CSV format, which can be used for analysis or reporting.
